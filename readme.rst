Project Description
**************************

This project is a web-based student accommodation system that aims to provide an accommodation search platform that will assist college students in exploring different places to stay during their stay in school.  

The platform will provide a unified platform for students to search for accommodations and agents to upload properties.  
The search functionality will provide students with access to a large selection of lodging options with a range of amenities. These accommodations were created with students in mind and are run by reputable accommodation agents. 

On the platform, students can locate the ideal residence of choice, whether searching for a shared or a solo apartment. Students will find apartments that meet both their demands and budget using search simple criteria. 

The map feature of the application will allow students to find housing possibilities near a university or in a neighborhood.
